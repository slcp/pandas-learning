  - `poetry shell` will activate a vitural environment. No need for `venv` in what I was doing already.
  - Data Frames are 2 dimensional
  - Each column in a Data Frame is a Series
    - Extra columns do not have to be added as a Series, a List works fine
  - Data Frame/Series `describe` method can be used to give a summary of numerical data/columns using common stats like max/mean/percentiles/etc
    - `include=[<data type, e.g. object/number]` can be used to force `describe` to provide stats about different data types
      - Allowed types - [https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/basics.html#basics-selectdtypes](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/basics.html#basics-selectdtypes)
  - `value_counts` produces a histogram or count of instances of values, by default it will use all columns in the frame
    - Select specific columns with `subset` arg
  - What is discretization - Continuous data is Measured, while Discrete data is Counted.
    - AKA binning, discrete binning, quantization
    - Put data into categories or bins, e.g. weight = light (under 50kg), midheavy (50-100kg), heavy (over 100kg)
      - This is instead of the underlying continuous data which is could be infinite (weight is a good example, something could be any weight)
  - There are element-wise and vector-wise operations available
    - Element-wise operations operate on each element individually and generally slower, a lot of functionality is provided by `numpy` under `pandas` that facilitate vector-wise operations of common use cases, e.g. sum, mean, calculations, etc
    - Vector-wise operations operate on an entire column/row/series at once and are more what `pandas` is geared towards, these operations are also significantly faster
  - Indexes
    - By default `pandas` creates a 0 based, integer index
    - Indexes are the address of your data in your data structure
    - Indexes are important for data visualisation and particularly for time series data
    - Labelling indexes is useful because the use of `.loc[]` with labels is a powerful way to locate data
    - MultiIndex?
  - What is a Panel?
    - Wide column representation, 3 dimensional. DEPRECATED
